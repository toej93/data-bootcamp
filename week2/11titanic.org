#+TITLE: The sinking of the Titanic
#+AUTHOR: Jim Fowler

One great source of both data *and* community is Kaggle.

Go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data to download data
describing passengers from the Titanic, and whether or not they
survived their voyage.  Can you use logistic regression (or any other
techniques!) to predict who surived?  (Perhaps "predict" is something
of a misnomer since the Titanic has already sunk!)
